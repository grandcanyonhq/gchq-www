The location is amazing and you feel off the grid and with nature. This location is perfect for star gazing, never seen a clearer night. This is a great way to get the camping experience with some luxury added in. There is a common area for all the casitas, which makes it good to cook, hang out and start a camp fire. We were the only ones during our stay so we had the entire place to ourselves. Mary was a great host, very attentive and quick to respond. Overall this was a great trip for us, one we will never forget and staying in Mary’s place was an unforgettable experience. I would love to come back in the future.<span class="font-bold">”</span></p>

In looking for accommodations, we knew we wanted to stay somewhere unique and unusual for our short 48 hour trip. We stumbled across this listing and instantly fell in love. We had both always been fascinated by tiny homes, but had never actually been in one. Everything about this Airbnb is a DREAM! From the moment we pulled up we were in complete awe at how quaint and adorable the property was! The home itself was exactly what we needed; clean, cute, cozy. We were able to watch the BEAUTIFUL sunset from the porch before making a lovely meal beside the fire wood stove. We stayed pretty much unplugged and enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere. At night, we went outside and actually saw the Milky Way for the first time! STUNNING! Accessibility was not nearly as hard as the reviews led us to believe, granted, we did not have inclement weather. HIGHLY
                recommend! We simply cannot wait to return. THANK YOU!<span class="font-bold">”</span>

Yes the casitas are duplexes, but we were not bothered by our neighbours at all. Lastly, the night sky was definitely A++ and such a great thing to experience.<span class="font-bold">”</span></p>
